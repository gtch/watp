watp
=======

Watp lets you use your laptop to provide signup forms for customers, volunteers, members, etc when you're holding an event. Place your laptop where people can use it, and ask them to fill in the form. You don't even need internet access on the laptop!

Key features:
* Uses a standard, familiar web form, but does not require internet access
* Comes with a simple template which allows intro, privacy and thankyou text to be customised
* Questions on the form are completely up to you, with several question types supported
* Responses are saved into CSV and XLS files

I wrote watp in a couple of hours for a particular event — because I couldn't find anything quite like it — so it does only what I needed for this event. Of course I'd love it if other people find watp useful. So if you use watp and have ideas for improvements or changes, please tell me in the [Issues section](https://github.com/gtch/watp/issues)
